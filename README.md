## Notes for running the API tests
Please note that these are only guidelines and that there are different ways of accomplishing the same results.
Also these are steps to follow if you're using a Debian based distribution.

Make sure these are installed in your general environment first:
#### Python3 (any version) 
`sudo apt-get install python3`

#### VirtualEnv 
  `sudo apt-get install virtualenv`
#### A few mysql needed packages sudo 
  `sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev`
  `sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev`

#### Setup a virtual environment:
  `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv`
  
#### Run your virtual environment:
  `source venv/bin/activate`

#### Finally:
- cd onto the folder where the file **requirements.txt** resides `cd team9_assignment/WebApi/`
- install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run the tests `python manage.py test`
